15-07-2025 :- Today i learned git

What is git - a distributed version control system 

Why git - Track project history 
          Supports collaboration
          Branching and merging 
          Backup of code in remote repositoried like GitHub

Key Concepts - 
    Repository - A folder where Git tracks your projects and its history
    Clone - Make  a copy of a remote Repository on your computer 
    Stage: Tell Git which changes you want to save next.
    Commit: Save a snapshot of your staged changes.
    Branch: Work on different versions or features at the same time.
    Merge: Combine changes from different branches.
    Pull: Get the latest changes from a remote repository.
    Push: Send your changes to a remote repository.

Configuration -     2 level - local, global, system
    git config --global user.name "your name "    
    git config --global user.email "your email"
    git cinfig user.name "Project Name"

16-07-2025 :- Today i solved one DSA question of reverse of words of string - import java.util.*;


        class Solution {
            public static void main (String args[]){
                Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
                System.out.print("Enter an string : ");
                String input = sc.nextLine();
                
                String reverseString = reverseWords(input);
                System.out.print("Here is your reverse String :" + reverseString);
            }

            public static String reverseWords(String s) {
                String[] words = s.trim().split("\\s+");

                StringBuilder reversed = new StringBuilder();

                for (int i = words.length-1; i >=0; i--){
                    reversed.append(words[i]);


                    if (i != 0){
                        reversed.append(" ");
                    }
                }
                return reversed.toString();
            }
        }

    I also explored about the CSS framework called TailwindCSS - Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework used to style web pages directly in HTML using predefined classes.
        Steps 1) Install Tailwind

              2) Set path of file in Configuration
            
              3) create CSS file

              4) build TailwindCSS using this command - npx tailwindcss -i ./input.css -o ./output.css --watch


17-07-2025 :- today i read an article it's not magic part 1 in which 
              the writer shares how using and building software can feel like magic, from early days with MapQuest to modern apps like Lyft. 
              But behind that magic are basic technologies like HTML, APIs, and databases. 
              Even though tech can seem boring, creating software still brings a special kind of joy.

              I also posted on linkedIn for joining Tech Mahindra Foundation. 

18-07-2025 :- Today i learned about API and fetching API like by map and Flatlist

21-07-2025 :- today I learned about fetch the data from the API ,
              I fetched ID and service_description.
